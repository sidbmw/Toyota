## About Toyota

Toyota Motor Corporation is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. Founded in 1937 by Kiichiro Toyoda as a spinoff from his father's company Toyota Industries, the company has grown to become one of the largest automobile manufacturers in the world.

## Generations

### Early Years (1937-1950s)
Toyota began as a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works devoted to the production of automobiles under the direction of Kiichiro Toyoda. The company's first passenger car, the Toyota AA, was produced in 1936. During World War II, the company primarily produced trucks for the Imperial Japanese Army. After the war, Toyota resumed production of passenger vehicles and began expanding its operations.

### Global Expansion (1960s-1980s)
Toyota began to expand internationally in the late 1950s, establishing Toyota Motor Sales USA in 1957. During the 1960s and 1970s, Toyota gained popularity in the United States with vehicles like the Corolla, which became one of the best-selling cars worldwide. The 1973 oil crisis boosted demand for the fuel-efficient vehicles that Toyota specialized in. In 1982, Toyota and GM formed NUMMI (New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc.), Toyota's first manufacturing plant in the United States.

### Innovation and Leadership (1990s-2000s)
In the 1990s, Toyota launched the Lexus brand as its luxury vehicle division, which quickly gained recognition for its quality and reliability. In 1997, Toyota introduced the Prius, the world's first mass-produced hybrid electric vehicle, demonstrating the company's commitment to environmental sustainability. By 2008, Toyota surpassed General Motors to become the world's largest automobile manufacturer by sales.

### Modern Era (2010s-Present)
Despite challenges such as the 2009-2011 recall crisis and the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, Toyota has maintained its position as one of the leading automotive manufacturers globally. The company has continued to innovate in areas such as hybrid technology, hydrogen fuel cells (with the Mirai), and autonomous driving. In recent years, Toyota has focused on developing its electrification strategy while maintaining investment in a diverse portfolio of powertrain technologies.
